# Getting Started with Products List App

Before you'll start the App, please install dependencies by running `yarn install` command. Then copy .env.dist to .env file. You may change url for getting data through API of your server or keep default value and get data from local json-server.

## Starting App

* If you've set up url for getting data from your server run `yarn frontend-start`. This will start the frontend app and get data from your server.
  

* If you've kept default url and want to get data from local server, run `yarn start`. This will start the frontend app on port 3000 and ***json-server*** as backend server on port 3001. Data will receive from the local data.json file.

## Open App
Once the app starts, just open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.
